Get Started with SvelteKit

Config Files:
</br>There are a lot of config files. I tried wrangling them into a `/config` directory, but that caused too many problems. Mainly the problems were in how the IDE and extensions handled things. It may be possible to accomplish, but I relented. Instead, you can use your IDE to hide most of them or use an extension to group and hide them.
